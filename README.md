# 📱 inSide — Psychological Dialogue Simulation Tool

## 📖 Project Description

**inSide** is a program that helps users process and prepare for important situations through simulated conversations.  
A person can create dialogues as if speaking with another party (for example, an HR manager, a friend, a teacher, or a family member) and ask themselves questions from that perspective.

This way, users can **mentally rehearse scenarios**, view situations from multiple angles, and emotionally prepare themselves for real-life experiences.

## 📌 How It Works

1. The user starts a new "dialogue session."
2. Creates as many participants (users) for the conversation as needed — for example: HR, Friend, Inner Critic, My Confident Self.
3. Writes questions or comments from the perspective of the other person by pressing shortcuts you set.
4. Responds as themselves.
5. Plays through the situation until they feel more confident or gain insight on how to approach it.

## 🧠 Psychological Benefits

The project is based on principles of **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)** and **mental rehearsal techniques**.

Scientific studies show that **playing out important scenarios in a safe environment**:
- reduces anxiety
- improves emotional regulation
- helps prepare logical and emotional responses in advance
- allows seeing a situation from another person’s perspective
- trains assertive and confident communication skills

Especially useful before:
- Job interviews  
- Exams  
- Difficult conversations  
- New experiences

## 🚀 Future Plans

- Progress tracking and statistics
- Random question generation by topic (e.g. interview, conflict, relationships)
- AI-based automatic dialogue generation
